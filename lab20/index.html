		<h1>Lab 20: JSON and APIs (XKCD comic!)</h1>
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p1>The challenges were to create the createOBJ key to call the object and input in the browser menu, especially from the help of W3schools (https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/ajax_getjson.asp).</p1>

			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p2>Some problems were structuring the comic keys from the given link (https://xkcd.com/info.0.json) in the right place with the right properties because the fifth step on task two in the homework instructions was confusing to understand. I had to contact my lab partner and group members at the same time to get clarifications regarding the tags. Then, it became understanding when they gave me some tips on how to work it properly which was very helpful.</p2>

			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p3>To look at the results, make sure this browser is running on Google Chrome because it needs the CORS header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' to function. Click on the button:</p3>
