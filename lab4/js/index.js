	// 2. Preheat the frying pan on the grill on low temperature. 
		// 3. Get pancake mix, milk, and eggs.
		// 4. Stir them together until there are no lumps present. 
		// 5. Dip the mix in the frying pan. The size of the pancake is optional.
	// 6. Turn the frying pan at medium temperature.
	// 7. To flip the pancake, make sure there are bubbles slowly popping all around the pancake first. This means that the cooked side of the pancake has turned brown. If it has not turned brown, wait a couple more minutes.
