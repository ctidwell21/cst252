		<h1>Lab 21: Git and Github</h1>
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p1>The challenges were to open up a new repository for my local files to be navigate from the folder in my desktop.</p1>

			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p2>One problem was that the files did not appear in the sidebar of the github page that I kept removing it from github that I accidentally deleted the folders to nearly all of my labs. I had to download all of them from my Cyberduck account which brought everything back.
