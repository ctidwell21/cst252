			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>The challenge was understanding the instructions from Task 1. Anna and I were trying to write our code and it was different. Mine had my id written as "output". The instructions said to use "div" as the output to find our element in the javascript. Then we received help from a scholar who is an expert at web scripting who said that my "div" output was supposed to be written as "output" to link it with the html page. It worked, overall.</p>
			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>The only problem for javascript was that the output id connected with the output in the javascript (as I mentioned in the Challenges paragraph).</p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>The javascript output is all displayed below:</p>
    	</div>
	</body>
