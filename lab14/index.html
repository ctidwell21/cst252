	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>The challenge was to the get the the constructor to implement the instantiated objects in the web browser.</p>
	<h2>Problems</h2>
	<p>Some big problems were that there were a lot of errors in the variable function to ouput the strings in the menu. The list of strings called from the constructor did not activate in the web browser. I decided to put a button click function documented and logged into the menu to test if the activation suceeded. It suceeded with the function. Another was that it needed a console.log() to be printed in the console of the inspection.</p>
