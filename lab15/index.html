	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>The challenge was to construct the objects to print the make and model of the chosen vehicle.</p>
	<h2>Problems</h2>
	<p>Some problems were that the construction had a few errors with the structure and that the moustache (brackets) were a little disorganized in some areas when I was messing around with the page.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>Click on the button below and see if the output describes make and model of the car altogether in the console menu:</p>
