	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>The major challenge was to organize loops in the right order. The remainder also had to be conditioned for the output return. I acquired some help from Anna and an expert at web coding named Jayson, who pointed out that I needed a variable string at the beginning and another loop, which requires a return of an inequal answer.</p>
	<h2>Problems</h2>
	<p>A major problem with the work was that it was difficult to find out which function in the javascript menu. It was supposed to be placed to output the information in the browser. Errors constantly appeared in the console menu, and so I decided to look back at my previous work and get help from Anna to understand what was not working. Some things that were needed were the input and output for the "document.getElementById" to make a connection with the identifications from the html menu, and the "outputEl" variable to output the results in the browser. This worked in the console menu.
	However, none of the outputs in the browser appeared on-screen when I entered the number. There was no click function nor a button to document it. I placed those functions in which still made no appearance in the browser. I was thinking through as to why the output has not showed up. Then I realized that the conditionals were written with console.logs rather than placing the value of the function. It successfully worked.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
