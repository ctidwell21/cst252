					<h1>Lab 19: AJAX</h1>
					<h2>Challenges and Problems</h2>
					<p2>Some problems were to search for the API links and data from different websites which were difficult to execute. When I put the links in the AJAX url, it seemed to have a problem loading the page and printing the json data in the browser menu of my web page. I went to the WorldPop site (https://www.worldpop.org/sdi/advancedapi) to find an interactive site that tracks the average population of age and sex groups per country. It works well but I am unsure if this site makes updates on the populated age groups.</p2>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p3>The results are supposed to be in the browser but it appears to not be working, even when there was no error on the result. However, the results are located in the console menu.</p3>
