	<h1>Lab 11: Conditionals</h1>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>Some challenges were the variables were not idenfied in relations to the sorting function and the html menu. For example, the "str" argument did not coordinate with the length variable, so I left it with "name" which worked.
	I also helped Anna with the sorting function when she was trying to follow the instructions as she was absent in class. She was having a little difficulty and gave her a lot of clarifications on what functions and variables were supposed to be typed step-by-step from the instructions and examples.</p>
	<h2>Problems</h2>
	<p>Some problems with the documentation tags in the javascript menu had errors indicated in the inspect sidebar in the browser. Some were unidentified and had syntax errors and needed to be fixed, because the variables were not coordinated with the other variables in the sorting function.</p>
