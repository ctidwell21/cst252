		<h1>Lab 7: JavaScript Functions</h1>
		<h2>Challenges and Problems</h2>
		<p>Some challenges was experimenting the document.writeln() output because it added a repetitive list of the same answer I inputted in the pop-up tab.</p>
		<p>Another problem was typing the name of the value in one of the function declarations set up in the javascript file. While I tested in the browswer, nothing appeared in the output as it did before. I deleted it and had to leave it blank with the single quotations ('').</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>The result is right here on the lab index.html file browser. The execution is below:</p>
