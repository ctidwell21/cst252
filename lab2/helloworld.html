	<p><strong>What's Up!?</strong></p>
	<p>My partner and I will tell you a little bit about ourselves. My name is Christian Tidwell and my partner is Anna Woldstad. We are both Communcation Design majors at CSU Monterey Bay. Something interesting, is that we are both taking this class again together. Although we have different major concentrations, we both share a common love for developing games. Thanks for letting us share of ourselves.</p>
