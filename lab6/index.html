		<h1>Lab 6: Arrays and Objects</h1>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>The only challenges Anna and I had trouble with were figuring out how the myTransport[1] reference worked after declaring our objects and arrays. We thought we were supposed to solve the reference properties through a list of objects. However, the only way to solve it was to just type myTransport[1] in the console. It simply gave the answer.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>Other than just the reference, there was not any problem I faced later in the assignment.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>The result is the overall html page for Lab 6. Here is the new script output:</p>
