			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>A very big challenge was to borrow the lab 7 javascript function into the lab 10 function to return the inputted name. I was trying to figure out which functions had to be inputted, so I placed the whole sortUserName function in order to return the inputted name. It worked once the javacript page was finished. 
			Additionally, with the help of a friend of mine name Sam, he asked what kinds of DOM functions are necessary to type in the javascript forum to get the input logged into the console. It was hard for me to answer as I was exhausted that night and did not have enough rest. He gave clarifications on how things worked and reviewed over to what each DOM element does. </p>
			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>After the review, Sam convinced me to start over with the DOM properties to see if I would be able to understand it without taking a look at the notes. It was hard for me to think while exhausted late at night, so I took a look back at the lecture and added the correct DOM elements he wanted me to put.
			Another problem was that I had trouble with getting the input to work. The only problem was to match the arguments with the input and identifications the DOM elements needed within the addEventListener function. Sam pointed that the "var inputValue = document.getElementById" argument needs an id from the html menu located in the input tag as a hint for me to figure it out.</p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>The results is the button with a console input to type your name in. Once the name is typed, it will present a couple sections with arrays listing the characters of your name.</p>
