	<h1>Lab 13: Basic Debugging</h1>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>the only challenge was working on the debugger tool with every javascript lab.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>The only problem was that one debugger tool did not pause in each function when I worked on lab 12. Then, the debugger tool was supposed to be at the beggining of the loop conditional pause the function one at a time.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>There are no results regarding the errors of the debugging tool, but the images of the process are presented in the "Debugging" section below.</p>
