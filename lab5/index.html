			<h1>Lab 5: Data Types and Variables</h1>
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>There were barely any challenges Anna and I had trouble with, other than the console we were figuring out how to use the data types and variables.</p>
			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>There was some trouble my partner and I dealt with the booleans. The "ownIt" boolean was confusing to get the true or false answer which led to an undefined one. 
			Anna's console wasn't working and stuff was not outputting. 
			Another problem was that the "document.writeIn()" tag in the javascript file did not create the output in the browser. It took me awhile to figure out why the output did not show up in the browser, and the answer was "document.write()". It worked on all the data outputted on the browser (see below "Script Output").</p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>The result is that you are looking at the overall html page for Lab 5. Here is the script output that took me a long time to solve:</p>
